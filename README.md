**Automates** operations **BEFORE** (when you place your phone against TAG when entering):

* enables wifi
* disables sounds
* sets low brightness
* the 3 above are configurable by students via a Control panel

* signs you up as present and sends the time you arrived to class to the database
* takes you to a link for your lecture notes for the day, **IF** they are available
* the 2 above are **NOT** configurable and will happen everytime

... and **AFTER** lectures (when you place your phone against the TAG one more time, when exiting):

* sends the time you got out to the database
* disables wifi
* enables sounds
* sets med-high brightness
* takes you to an online survey where you submit feedback, **IF** one is available
* again, they are configurable or not in a similar fashion to the **BEFORE** actions

** Please note this version cannot be compiled and run at this time because not all files are uploaded (only code for now). But the repo will be updated soon with all necessary files and instructions to compile, run and use the app and manage the database. **
